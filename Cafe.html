								<span class="auto-style1">Mews Cafe in Penang is a locally owned cafe situated in Muntri House Hotel in Georgetown, Penang. Done in all light colours; white walls, light floors, and white marble table tops, the interior of Mews Café is calming and relaxing with a lot of natural light coming in from the full length windows and doors. The lush greeneries that are well taken care of outside give peace; there are also seating outside to be close enough to be one with nature. The air of the café is casual but some of the décor does give it a little bit of sophistication. 
</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">The menu here comprises of two cuisines; local and from the West. Items from both type of cuisines have enjoyed a strong support from the customers and thus leading to raving reviews about this place on the net.

One such dish is the Nasi Lemak Bento, a serving of the ultimate local favourite, Nasi Lemak, in a Japanese Bento box.

			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 			<span class="auto-style1">Georgetown’s best-hidden secret is probably the only place in town that sells churros and cronuts, bringing American delights into the heart of Penang. The churros are renowned for being crispy and fluffy and a choice of five dips is offered. The cronuts, drenched in either salted caramel or nutella, will certainly make you drool. Not to be missed is The Alley’s affogato, made up of a scoop of Haagen-Daz ice cream paired with the café’s locally roasted signature coffee.  </span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">China House is one of the most established names in Penang’s cafe scene. Combining three heritage houses into one fancy space, you enter the cafe from Beach street and exit at Victoria street instead. Although all three of the heritage houses fall under China House, each house is decorated differently and commands a distinct vibe - thus, visitors can choose to be in a cafe, a dining hall, or a bar.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 		 <span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 								<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">The cafe section of China House is where you will spot a glorious cake spread prepared by Beach Street Bakery, and is every cake lover’s dream.  The presence of arts is strong here too, as the cafe houses a gallery upstairs and live performances every night at the bar section called The Canteen. There are too many reasons for one to visit China House, and that is why the cafe has enjoyed a regular stream of lively crowd since its opening.  </span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">Majority of Cafe in Penang won their customers over by possessing an unique theme or exquisite interior design. However, we are more impressed with theirs lavish meals at The Book Sandwich Cafe rather than its design. Located at Beach Street, this cafe themed around books and may escape the horizons if just driving by. The food itself, though priced at a higher range deserve a visit despite difficulties in parking.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 			 <span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 								<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1"></span>The cafe is hungry to prove himself as the sandwich master. The bread is looked like chef’s masterpiece. It was delicious, slight-crispy on the outside and fluffy as a pillow inside. The interior, somehow aligned with its cafe’s name, pretty much in the indie way, as it has a lot of books, perched on the wall.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">Follow this address 2015, Lebuh Pantai, 10300, Georgetown, Penang to find this place. They opens from 12PM-10PM daily but are close on monday and you can reach them by contacting +604-261 3445.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">Finding a cool and fun place to chill out with friends can be pretty easy these days in Penang, especially with all these new shopping malls around, but if you wish to escape from a noisy and crowded environment, you will probably want to check this place out. </span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 			 <span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 								<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">. Its a cafe with very good ambiance, comfortable couch with colorful pillows, rocking chair etc....Parking can be a problem during office hour/lunch hour. Price-wise, was okay since there are no service charge nor government tax adding to your bill. Seats are pretty limited based on my observation, hence, reservation is strongly recommended. No doubt, its a very good and suitable place for your to laze around during your break time. The only draw back was, they are operating their business in the late afternoon (i.e.3pm) and in return, they are opening until 12am midnight, so you can consider this a place for supper as well.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">One of their signature dishes will be Waffle Salmon (Rm12). It consists of a few slices of smoked salmon, scrambled egg, crispy waffle spread with a generous amount of mayonnaise, sprinkled with some black pepper and some fresh herbs. This whole portion was more than enough for a big eater like me, mainly due to its creaminess and buttery flavor. The soft and fluffy scrambled egg blended well with the special aroma from the smoked salmon. The crispy waffle contributed to the overall texture as well. Recommended. You can go to this shop by following this address 15 and 17, Jalan Nagore, Penang. (somewhere opposite US Pizza) Their opening hours are Sunday to Thursday, 3pm to 12am; Friday to Saturday, 3pm to 2am. Closed on every Tuesday. You can also reach them by contacting +604- 226 0562. </span><br class="auto-style1"/>
