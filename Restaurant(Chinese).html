</span><br class="auto-style1"/> 
			
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								<span class="auto-style1">You will find classic local dishes such as char kway teow (fried flat rice noodles with shrimp, bean sprouts and cockles) and satay (barbecue honey-glazed chicken skewers with spicy peanut sauce), but it is less spicy than what you find in regular kopitiams (coffee shops). Besides Malaysian dishes, you can also order international stalwarts like pizza and Japanese tepanyaki. Do take note that the food is slightly more expensive than standard coffee shops, with a roll of deep fried popiah (fresh spring roll with julienne of carrots, steamed turnips, chilli sauce and sweet sauce, wrapped in a soft, paper-thin crepe) costing about RM3 – about one ringgit more than usual.<br />

			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 			<span class="auto-style1">The selection of foods provided for the buffet is plenty and since it's a buffet, you can eat as much as you can. It’s pandan Chicken and  Satays, the restaurant also serves an array of prawns prepared in different ways if one fancies some form of seafood.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 <span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 								<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Offering a variety of tasty Malay dishes, Andrew’s Kampung restaurant is something of an undiscovered gem, and a pleasing alternative to the touristy eateries. In the most unassuming location, the second floor restaurant cooks up a number of unpretentious and local delicacies. 
The all you can eat buffet costs 27 MYR and comes highly recommended. The sizzling chicken and beef noodles are a spicy treat, typical of the island.

								<span class="auto-style1">Tek Sen used to be known as Teik Seng Rice Stall, a stall selling Chinese style rice with dishes since 1965. With a wide range of cuisines; Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka, and Peranakan, no wonder it has managed to attract a number of people even until today. </span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 			<span class="auto-style1">It is considerably easy for a shop that has been around for so long to lose their original touch but such is not the case for Tek Sen. No longer operating from their original location, the new building seem modern, thus may imply nothing about their colourful past, but the setting was still done in the old, free style that would allow the customers to enjoy the simplicity of the re-named Tek Sen.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 <span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 								<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Realistically, signature dishes at certain restaurants may not fit the ‘signature’ title, but Tek Sen’s signature has always been the choice of patrons for decades. The dishes are Assam Tumis Fish, Trotters in Black Vinegar ‘Tu Kha Chor’, and the Double Roasted Pork Fried with Chilli Padi ‘Char Siew Bak’. You can find this restaurant at 18 Lebuh Carnarvon, George Town, Penang Island 10100, Malaysia. It opens from 12PM-4:30PM and 6PM-9PM. If you want to reconfirm their opening hours or make reservation you can contact +60 12-981 5117. </span><br class="auto-style1"/>

Famous for its roasted chicken and duck rice, many have made their way to the bustling streets of Jalan Cintra. This restaurant was originally from the main branch called Sin Lam Fatt Roasted Chicken and Duck Rice.

								<span class="auto-style1">Hidden in some village outskirt of Raja Uda, Ong Cheng Huat Seafood provides one of the cheapest and freshest seafood that you can possibly find in Penang. The exact location is a bit tedious to find, do ask the people around for directions and I am sure that they will be more than willing to help. </span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 			 <span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 								<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">There are not much options in Ong Cheng Huat Seafood as they focus mainly in a few dishes only and most of them are assured of certain quality. The prices for every single dishes are unexpectedly cheaper as compared to those over-rated Seafood eateries in Penang island. I was totally amazed by their serving speed, it took around 10 minutes for them to serve us all the dishes ordered but do not expect much from the ambiance, though it has improved since then. From Penang Island, exit at Bagan Lalang highway and drive straight until you hit a traffic light (with a lake on your left and factories on your right), turn right into the road. Keep driving straight until you hit a traffic light again, keep going straight. After approximately 5 minutes, pay attention to your left hand side for the banner stating Ong Cheng Huat Seafood. This is definitely one of my favorite places to think of when it comes to Octopuses and Fresh Fish Head.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
